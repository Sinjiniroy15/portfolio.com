    <article>After 12th , I took admission in National Institute of Technology Agartala in CSE, through JEE mains scores. </article>
    <br>
    <article>Taking admissions in such reputed engineering colleges is not easy. Students have to give entrance examinations and 
        then they have to clear the cut-offs and after clearing all such hurdles, then only one can get admitted into NIT's. The name of the engineering entrance is JEE MAINS</article>
